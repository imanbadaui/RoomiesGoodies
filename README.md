# MY FINAL PROJECT

**RoomiesDuties** is a web app that helps roommates keep track of all the items in their home, whether theyâ€™re shared or personal. It makes it easy to see what youâ€™ve bought, avoid unnecessary purchases, and budget better for both shared and personal items. This helps cut down on food waste and saves money by organizing what everyone needs.

## What does it do?

- **Admin Functionality**: 
  - **Admins (homeowners)** can grant new usernames for incoming roommates, allowing them to create accounts and access the homeâ€™s product database.
  - Only granted usernames saved in the database can create profiles and log in.
  
- **Roommate Functionality**: 
  - Roommates can specify product details and decide whether to allow others to use the item or keep it personal.
  
- **Dashboard**: 
  - The app includes a dashboard with a table that tracks:
    - **Product Code**: Auto-generated, unique for labeling
    - **Name**
    - **Owner**
    - **Price**
    - **Type**: (e.g., fruits, vegetables)
    - **Quantity and Unit**
    - **Access**: Whether itâ€™s shared or personal
  
- **Item Management**: 
  - Any roommate can add, edit, or delete items from the shared product list.
  - Admins can view the list of usernames stored in the database to grant unique usernames for new roommates.
  
- **Search Capabilities**: 
  - Filter products by type or by which roommate owns them, making it easier to manage.

## Unique Feature

**Admin-Grant Login**: Users can log in only if the homeowner gives them a username in person. Itâ€™s like a secret username that only the admin and the roommate know. Shhhhhhhhhh! ðŸ¤«
